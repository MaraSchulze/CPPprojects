# All 10 CPP Projects of 42School
The 10 CPP projects taught us the basics of object-oriented programming and the basics of CPP.  
The description of the projects are in the respective project folder in the pdf file.  

## I passed all projects with 100%

## Usage
These programs were written for and compiled on a Mac.  
```
cd CPP<n>
cd ex<0x>
make
./<programname>
```

## Caveats
We had - at this time - to program adhering to standard 98.  
Also from project 2 upwards we had to use the orthodox canonical form for classes.
